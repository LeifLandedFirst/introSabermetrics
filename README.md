## Running MySQL in command line

Go to the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/">MySQL Community Server</a> download page and select the DMG archive for your version of OS X.

Once downloaded, open the DMG file and run both package installers.

Once both packages are installed, open a terminal window and run the following command, which starts MySQL server:

```
sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start
```
